For these custom landing pages I used Understrap starter theme to start my project.

I then build the page using PHP, HTML, Bootstrap, and SASS from scratch. The files shown here are just the main files I edited on.

Some other libraries that were used were Animate.css, which was used for cross-browser animations.
